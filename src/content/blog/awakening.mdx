Hello darlings~~

Today I want to tell you about my,, *encounter* last sunday. A fateful meeting that inspired me to create this site
and my dark account at [@rose@pleasebite.me](https://pleasebite.me/@rose), so that hopefully I can fill it with lots
of stories in the future ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ

First I want to tell you a bit about the story that primed me for this, the overall weekend I had that made me desperate
for the kind of affection I would thankfully receive~~~ I was attending an Event that weekend of the 1st where I would
meet many people for the first time, most of which I knew from online spaces. As a big extrovert and cuddly person this
was really exciting, I love meeting new people and I also hoped that I would get some cuddles out of it~~ Experience
tells me that very queer spaces are usually full of cuddly people and relationship anarchists, and this was a space
attracting lots of them so my hopes were a bit higher than usual.

I arrived on Friday evening to meet up with the people I would share a room with, get a bit of a feel for the city, and
meet other early arrives. After my train rolled into station I quickly met my generous hostess who graciously planned
our hotel stay and together with another cute arrival we headed for the hotel to check in and leave the bulk of our
stuff in our Rooms. Afterward we headed to a cute little vegan Restaurant to meet with more people and grab a bite.
The cute arrival from earlier caught my interest and when she told us she would only eat a little snack, since she
needed to pick up a partner at the train station later, I was building the resolve to accompany her. When time came for
her to leave I decided to accompany her. We had a nice walk to the train station and as the train was still due to
arrive we grabbed a coffee at the local expensive franchise coffee shop that sold me a passable iced late. We had a nice
talk, I got to learn a bit about her work, it was a pleasant time. When the train arrived with her partner we left to
meet with another group so all could have dinner as well.<br />
We arrived at the Restaurant, actually the same one as earlier. Since I already had my share of tasty snacks I wasn't
gonna pick up food, but staying and talking to the others and seeing who arrived was what I was there for anyway.
One of the entities that joined us was actually known to me, so that was a nice reunion.

But then we got joined by someone I haven't met before,,,,,, **her**,,,

This beauty, this goddess that only the greek would have done justice describing, arrived. **Her** grace was accentuated
by a beautiful set of black cat ears adorned with tiny trinkets in a Japanese vibe. **Her** Aura told of a strong woman,
a leader, which I could identify with and I felt companionship. **She** was a little bit taller than me and chatting
with **her** in this group setting was nice already. After everyone had received their food for take out we went to a
quieter corner so everyone could eat in piece. Afterward when the question of ongoing plans arisen the cute person I
followed earlier wanted to take their partner to their hotel to rest, so they left. After another departure only I,
the entity known to me, and **her** were left. After a bit of discussion and **her** mentioning that **her** hotel had
a nice bar that's where we went. There I ordered a glass of chardonnay, as I wanted to open up a little. I did not
intend to get drunk on the first evening in the city, but I love wine, and it does have an effect on me fast. It was
nice chatting with those two and as I started my second glass I was getting more and more flirty~~ My company did not
drink anything alcoholic, but regardless my flirts towards **her** were not unanswered. The way **she** joined in on it
was refreshing, as all my teasing that evening and in my life in general was very fruitless, probably taken for silly
flirts for fun and leisure instead of seeing the real potential for affection informing them,,,, As my second glass was
empty and the time approached midnight, I raised that I could walk the 20 minutes to my hotel room, or **she** could
take me to **hers**. Surprisingly my not-just-slightly intoxicated self was not met with the usual light-hearted
rebuttal, but with **her** mentioning that normally **she** could totally take me to **her** room, for cuddles and
making out,,, I was not quite prepared for that, but also I was drunk, and as I am very careful in such a vulnerable
state I told **her** I would not make out with **her**, but I am available for cuddles. I am of the intense conviction
that consent is the sexiest thing that exists and as I was drunk myself then, I could not give it. It takes quite a lot
of alcohol to make me able to not be this careful and I will not be getting myself that drunk if not around people I
already trust a lot (I apologize to my bestie here for many such evenings). I had learned later that this left an
impression on **her**. Because of past experiences, **she** usually would seek distance from someone intoxicated, but
to **her** surprise me being in that state did not trigger that familiar instinct. Because of that **she** suggested
making out to **her** own surprise, and was relieved and impressed when I turned that down. As alluded to earlier,
I could not stay with **her**, the other entity we were with was going to spend a bit of time **her**, so I left for
my own hotel, forgetting to get her number as I was drunk and overwhelmed... I ended up in my bed alone.

As the sun had risen on Saturday, I and others got up. I had gone through my beauty routine and picked my outfit, we
joined some others for some coffee. **She** was still on my mind, and I had hoped to run into **her** again at the
event, but that was not to be that day. I had spend quite some time that day with the cute companion I met on my first
arrival and got to spend some time with our group. In the evening we all went to our hotel room to play
games and hang out. At some dinner before that I also met another cute person I flirted with, but I later learned she
was taken so that wouldn't have lead to anything anyway. The frustration (/lh-ish) from that was still with me when at
the hotel. Some of our group were playing a card game on the floor next to the bed, I and some others were laying on it.
I was on my tummy, so I could follow the game and also tease my cute little friend a little bit~~ Over the evening I
had fun caressing her legs and leaning onto her every now and then, hyping up myself a little bit on finally receiving
some affection after the tease that was last evening and the uneventful dinner,,,, but when it was getting late, she
would go to her room to join her partner that wanted to rest... I suggested that she could stay with a flirtatious
voice, but to no avail...... I was once more going to bed alone.

On Sunday much the same morning, another iced late, another slow start in the day and going to the event. In the
afternoon my list of disappointments got added to by virtue of the cute persons early departure. As she had to catch a
train, she could not stay until Monday like many of us. Her sudden leaving also meant I didn't catch her to say
goodbye... This saddened me greatly as I was building the courage to suggest a little parting kiss that I was now unable
to follow through on,,,<br/>
The day was coming to an end, and while I was able to cheer up a little bit from that disappointment, as the evening
approached I was resigning myself to this being another disappointing weekend at an event where I was not getting my
fill of touch, going home starving once more..<br/>
when it happened.<br/>
On the way with a friend to the cafeteria I was delighted to see,,,,,<br/>
**her**,,,,,<br/>
we were in a hurry so my brain was in high gear. After a little reunion I did not waste time on asking **her** for
**her** number. **She** happily obliged. I now had **her** number in my phone and was happily moving on to accompany my
friend and then join the rest of our group again. As I was starting to write **her** I got asked if I wanted
to hang. I told **her** about the Restaurant we were about to go to. **She** actually went there the day before and
told me it was a nice place, and asked if I wanted **her** to join. I did. **She** came over and joined our group.
I once more had a nice chat with **her** and some others, but I was more focused on **her** this time. Starved for
affection I wanted to know where this could lead...

As our group was departing the event we went to the local streetcar. It was packed as with the event closing,
most people were on the way out. When we boarded the little train car there was not much space, so **her** and I were
close to each other. In the vicinity of the group but too detached, we had time to just talk with each other without
much interference. Talking to **her** was pleasant as always, and when I shared how my weekend disappointed me so far
with my fruitless flirtations **she** asked me if I like ear scratches. I told **her** that I don't know, nobody offered
me that before, but I was intrigued. As **her** hand touched the side of my head and **her** nails started to caress it,
combing the short hair I had on my right side due to my side-cut, I immediately noticed how gentle **she** was, how
precise, and how much I *craved* this. It was such a little gesture, but I was starved as I've always been. **Her**
touch reminded me of another person I loved hopelessly but also, had something new I haven't experienced before. This
already made my brain go blank. It felt like the first sip of water after thirsting the entire day, like the first bite
of your meal after a day of hard work. As I was talking to **her**, sharing stories with **her**, I more and more
paused forgetting words or what I wanted to say; as I started melting more and more from **her** touch. After the
ride that felt like the shortest eternity, we embarked from the station to the Restaurant. **She** offered me **her**
hand to hold on the way. **Her** hands were wrapped in leathery gloves, who which I would become familiar with the
coming day, I delightfully accepted. We walked with this group of like 15 people, of which only one I really engaged
with,,,

When we sat down and had ordered food, I had my head played with again. At some point the topics of our conversations
became more,,, targeted. As I grieved about my unfulfilled needs from this weekend I was asked what those needs
were. As I shared my like for cuddles and affection **she** told me about herself.. and the things ***she*** does to
people. As a top and also a dominat person, **she** is no stranger to playing a role to fulfill peoples needs, deriving
great pleasure from that. ***She*** can be scary if that is what they like~~ **She** did not expect much from this
weekend, so **she** only brought **her** leash and clicker, never travels without it, but there are many things one can
do with their body alone. We weren't gonna need those tools today, but something else caught my eye... **Her** notes
mentioned putting people into "subspace" with cues; I did not know what that was, felt pretty shy and innocent asking..
I wouldn't be left in the dark for long. I told **her** my boundaries, my limits, my pleasures. I am very inexperienced in
these matters and do not derive much pleasure from pain. I told **her** about the sensitivities I have around my belly due to
family history, and how much I enjoyed ***her*** playing with my head and my hair. I had played around with shibari and
ropes before but what **she** was talking of was way beyond everything I've ever done. **She** shared it mostly just to show
me the things **she** can do, not as an opportunity for today but a primer for how open I can speak. **She** told me about how
she enjoys ***her*** time with people, that as a top **she** lives through the experiences of the people **she** spends
time with. I am sure when **she** will read these lines **she** will derive much euphoria from them once more. I am a very
caring person, I love to make other people happy a lot. When someone does things for me, I usually get concerned about
how to give back. I remember that in between melting in **her** hands I was getting concerned I was not giving back
enough, I wanted to stroke **her** hair too, I wanted to caress **her** to... but I was not able to, I was entranced by
**her** every touch; I was unable to move, I could only.. enjoy. Hearing **her** tell me that deriving pleasure from others
enjoyment, and living through others and enjoying and hearing their happy memories was what **she** was after; I started
talking about a person very special to me, telling about my most happiest memories I had with them. More and more I
started to see how much **she** enjoys hearing this, I started seeing how much **she** gets from me getting so much
out of **her** every touch. The guild of a woman that had to look after others, even people tasked with looking after
her, the guild of only taking instead of exchanging, was starting to melt away. My priority started to shift, from
transacting, to enjoying, and sharing how much I enjoyed. I stopped holding back, letting the Identity of the strong
and competent leader drift away &dash; not because it's not who I am, but it's not who I needed to be here, who I could
be. As **her** nails on my skin stroke away the emotional barriers build over the past 26 years of my life, as I felt
more comfortable exposing my bare, emotional, seeking, hungry, needy, greedy, thirsty, yearning, desperate, starving,
needing, wanting self to **her**... I was getting excited,,, anxious,,, and happy,,,,,, <br/>
As dinner concluded, we embarked on our way to **her** hotel. A quick stop at mine to grab my things, as I would have had
to check out the next day before 10 otherwise.

We arrived at **her** hotel, I had hold **her** hand during our entire taxi ride and during the walk. We rode the
Elevator to **her** room. I was almost dizzy from the suspense... and yearning. Entering **her** room... putting down
my things... I took in the ambiente. A nice, little room, a great view, an inviting bed.. I took in the sight I was
about to enjoy for tonight. As I was standing there, my coat and shoes in the wardrobe, my bags next to me, I watched
**her** prepare some tea. **She** asked me if I wanted some myself, I declined, **she** phoned the hotel to book late
checkout for the next day. **She** came up to me.. so close.. **she** started giving me ear scratches again. I asked
**her** what **she** wanted me to take off first.. **she** wanted my shirt gone,,, I obliged nervously. I stood there,
with my cute bra, my favorite one; Little shapes and colors on it that make it look really cute with this dark blue tint.
**She** inspected me, asked me where I got it from. When I alluded to its origin **she** laughed heavily, breaking a
lot of the tension for me. I love making people laugh, and it helps me be more comfortable. I laid down on **her** bed,
watching **her** undress,,,,, **She** joined me, taking me into **her** arms, **her** leg resting on mine. **She**
caressed my hair,, **her** nails running over my skin,,,, I melted more and more. I told **her** joyful memories,
I watched my guild and my worries melt away, my skin even stopping to goosebump as my entire being was starting to
embrace **her**. I warmed up to **her**, **she** took of my bra and started caressing my breasts,,,,,,, **She**
constantly asked me before touching me if it was okay being touched in various places, always making sure I was
comfortable, **her** display of concern and **her** heavy emphasis on consent alone was enough to make me light-headed.
Any doubt in my mind about **her** motives, any doubt about **her** enjoyment of my please melted away, I opened up. I felt
silly and shy, but I asked "can you bite me?". In the way I was becoming familiar with by now **she** asked me to
clarify and specify what it was I wanted, needed and was comfortable with. **She** remembered that I did not seek pain,
clarified the biting **she** is used to is the type that is intended to leave beautiful bruises, but I was probably
seeking a more playful bite? I said yes, I wanted neck bites, I wanted **her** to paint on the canvas of my shoulders
not just with the light brush of **her** nails, but apply the broad strokes of **her** teeth. **She** explained to me
where **she** would want to bite me, pointing out the broad muscle sitting on top of the shoulder connecting the arm to the
neck. **She** said it was a place where **she** would be comfortable biting me, as it was a pretty safe place to bite
**she** had some experience with. I asked **her** where **she** wanted me, **she** told me I should lie down between
**her** legs.

I moved up a bit, over **her**, laying down in the embrace of **her** body. **Her** arms welcomed me, **her** legs
lightly wrapped around me. **She** kept touching me, **her** nails running over my skin, playing with my hair, caressing
my breast.<br />
**Her** hands ran over my skin, over my chest, past my neck, arriving. **Her** legs propped up, **her** hands supported
my back. **She** lifted me a slight amount, bringing my shoulder and neck closer to **her** mouth. **Her** lips
touched my skin, **her** teeth came down on me. **She** sucked in my skin and muscle to get hold of it with **her** teeth.<br/>
I feel **her** teeth gently grasping me.<br/>
My body gets flooded with emotion, with euphoria, with a light pain, my breath sharpens.<br/>
**Her** legs wrap tightly around me, **her** thighs press against my body, **her** teeth munch down on my shoulder. My
head gets flooded with emotion, with feeling, lightheadedness turns into emptiness, bliss, euphoria. Everything around me
vanishes, I close my eyes, I feel **her**, I embrace **her**, my body tenses up, the room disappears.<br/>
**Her** teeth keep munching on me, every thrust followed by me grasping for air, my head laid to my side, pressed to my
side, my neck inviting **her** deeper and deeper.<br/>
**She** lets go.<br/>
I sink into **her** arms, resting on **her** chests and **her** breasts. **Her** arms and legs invite me again. **She**
caresses my hair again, **she** runs **her** nails over my skin again, but this time, everything **she** does is so much
more intense. My head is blank, resting to the side, stretching my neck like I wanted **her** to bite down on it and
consume me, because I did. I wanted to describe to **her** how I felt... Speaking was difficult, I grasped for metaphors.
I, who had described everything and anything with metaphors all my life, struggled to form coherent sentences. I
wanted to share with **her**, not just through the tensing and de-tensing of my body, not just through my sharp and deep
breaths; I wanted to share it all, I wanted **her** to know how I feel, at least just a fraction of it.<br/>
As I had to catch my breath, caressed by **her** hands, **she** readied another bite.<br />
I was lifted slightly once more, leaning my head to the other side this time. I felt **her** lips on my skin again,
the anticipation a short sweet tease,,,, when it started again.<br />
**She** grasped my shoulder with **her** teeth, **she** bit down, **she** wrapped **her** legs around me, **she** bit,
**she** grasped, **she** grabbed, **she** wrapped, **she** caressed, **she** bit, **she** sucked, **she** bit,,,,,,
oh my god, oh my--- everything is even more intense,,,,,,,, my body tensed up with every bite, relaxed a little in
between, the tension in my shoulders I had for weeks melted away. Oh my---,,,,,,,,<br />
yesss,,,<br />
I deserve this<br />
I was a good girl<br />
This is what I need<br />
yesss,,,,,,<br />
,,,<br />
**Her** teeth let go once more, **her** body invited me to relax, I melted into **her** arms, **her** chest welcomed me,
**her** hands caressed me, **her** legs housed me, **her** nails ran over my skin, **her** hands touched my chest.<br />
This time, I can't speak a word. I am lost for words, **her** every touch louder than the loudest concert, smoother
than the best whiskey, more calming than a freshly brewed tea enjoyed by the seaside. In 26 years of my life was I never
able to build a home as welcoming as **her** embrace felt in these moments.<br />
So that was subspace,,,,,,<br />
Minutes passed as I grasped for words, as my brain tried to collect the semblance of function, more drugged than any
alcohol could ever hope to achieve, more euphoric than any experience could ever provide. Attempts at speech resulted
in some small noises, some breaths, nothing more. **She** held me and caressed me, as I embarked on the arduous journey
of relearning to talk. **Her** every touch felt the most intense it ever felt. I felt like I had been wearing a thick
layer of clothes all my life, and I put it off for the first time. **Her** every touch so much more intense.
**Her** every touch giving me such euphoria.

As I regained the ability to speak, I once more tried to share my experience with **her**. This time I just wanted
to describe the absolute serenity I was experiencing. I told how once before, about a year ago, during meditation
I've reached this ideal state, where all thoughts, even intrinsic once, were gone. It was a very forming experience,
my head usually buzzing with thought completely quiet, the ADHD turned off, I was given complete control over my Head.
Back then I was able to reprogram some of my behavior in this state, it felt like I've been given administrative access
to my own thought process, I learned to like myself more, to forgive myself more. It was an almost spiritual experience.
The state my head was in now reminded me of this, and even days later my head was still more calm and serene.
Between all the buttons **she** pressed **she** found the reset button, and **she** pushed it hard,,,

As I was ready again, I got to enjoy **her** embrace, another bite,,,, This time when **she** was done I at least
had enough of my head together to tell **her** that I want **her** to kiss my neck. **She** did. **Her** lips on my neck
were so sweet, **her** kiss so gentle. Every one gave me intense feelings of euphoria and happiness, while at the
same time I was barely able to feel it, my entire body was getting numb from all the happy chemicals flooding it.
I was so overwhelmed and so happy, every little kiss of **hers** being a sweet desert to the best dinner of my life.

At this point, I forgot how many times we had done this. My head goes blank just putting myself back there.

With every following bite, I opened up more and more, my body got into it more and more. I tensed and de-tensed with
every thrust of **her** teeth. I moved like I was having the best sex of my life, but this gave me so much more
than sex could have ever given me. A single touch of **her** felt better than any orgasm I ever had. **Her** constant
care, **her** gentle touch, **her** constant reassurances verbal and non-verbal that I was doing great, that **she**
only touched me where I liked, that **she** made sure to care for me between every bite **she** took into my shoulder
and out of my being. The way **she** enjoyed *my* enjoyment. I tried to share as much with **her** as possible, to give
**her** as much as possible, but I also just wanted. This is what I fantasized about for years but even more. I told
**her** every wish I had and **she** obliged happily. **She** monitored the sharpness of my breath with everything
**she** did, to maximize what I was getting out of it and the pleasure **she** gave me. **She** looked for every button
on my body, found them and pressed them with precision and intensity. I felt like I was breaking, but in the best way
possible. **She** had bitten me many more times. Caressed me every time. Wrapped around me every time. Cared for me
every time. Embraced me every time. Eventually, I grabbed **her** left hand, and placed it on my belly. That spot that I
previously explained to **her** only a person I trusted could touch, I invited **her**, the third person ever to touch
me there.

At some point I was out of energy, out of need or want. I was given everything. I turned around and rested my head
on **her** chest. **Her** warm arms embraced me, caressed my head, gave me those now so familiar head scratches. I told
**her**, for the first time in my life, I had all my needs fulfilled, there is nothing more I could ask for. I tried
thinking about something, but no matter how deep I felt into myself, all was calm and satisfied. I know whatever else
I would ask of **her** I could get, so I looked around inside of me to find anything more I can take, and share... but
nothing. Truly nothing. I was just happy, and exhausted. The complete silence inside of me, so peaceful.

We laid there for a while as I was coming to my senses again. **She** kissed my head. I talked about how for a long
while now, many of my close friends told me how I deserved things. How when I told of that person I was in love with
but wasn't loved back, they told me I would deserve a love like that. I was told how much happiness I deserved for
the kind of caring person I am, how I always listened and tried my best. It took me years to even accept that I don't
always have to put myself above others and even more to see that I do deserve that. However, no matter how much I was
told I deserve, I never got.<br />
Today. I got it.<br />
I fucking got what I deserved. **She** told me I deserved this and yes I did. I felt so blissful, I've gotten what I
deserved,,, Finally,,,,,,

As we readied for bed, I put on my sleep pullover with "Nap queen" on it, to **her** delight. I noticed bruising on my
shoulders, hickeys, they made me incredibly happy. Running my hands over them reminded me of the lips that
painted them. The next days these bruises would be a little escape from the mundane of everyday life, putting me back
into that bed, back to **her**. I slept so nicely. **She** spooned me, but like I've never been spooned before.
**Her** embrace was so much more intense and I called **her** arms my home now. I slept so nicely...

We slept until like 09:00, cuddled an hour or two longer before leaving bed. **Her** legs rested on mine, my head
pressed to **her** chest, embraced by **her** arms. I've never felt so close to someone. **Her** hands scratching my
head, **her** nails running over my skin, **her** lips kissing my head.

I wanted to meet up with the rest of my group again for some final coffee and lunch. Since **she** booked late checkout
we could leave our stuff in **her** room. After navigating local public transport and getting others to answer
my messages, since they've already been up for hours by the time I left bed, we all found together at a little cafe.
I got to hold **her** hand all the way, got more scratches and was overall just so happy and relaxed. I got coffee,
held **her** hand every now and then. Someone from my group at one point asked **her** if that means we are together now,
we laughed. We don't know how serious that question really was, but I pulled down my blazer a little bit, revealing the
bruises on my shoulders and proclaimed "those are platonic bite marks" &dash; **she** laughed and agreed. We had
fun with that to the confusion of the others. I felt like a silly teenager.

We went to a Taiwanese inspired vegan Restaurant with parts of the group, said goodbye to the others whose trains
were already about to depart. The Restaurant was nice, the food was tasty. We fooled around a bit more as the departure
time of my, now our, train approached. As **she** was going the same direction as me, **she** bought matching train
tickets, to spend a little bit more time together. We collected our stuff at the hotel, and caught our train.
Once seated I got my laptop out, answered the most important messages and emails in need of immediate answer, closed it
up and sunk into **her** arms. The ICE chairs were really not made for cuddling, but we did our best, and it didn't
matter anyway as long as I got to be with **her**, having little whispering conversations. We talked so much during
the ride, it was so nice,,, Originally I would have changed to a different train than **her**, but since ours
was delayed and I could have taken **hers** to get home too, I decided to stay to get to spend even more time with
**her**. We talked more about ourselves and boundaries and wishes, at some point **she** asked me something that I was
already thinking about the entire day... would I want a parting kiss?<br />
I told **her** I couldn't tell yet, I was still processing the weekend and all I could say right now is that I
want wanting one. A moment later I asked **her** if ***she*** wanted to kiss me. **She** asked me to look at
**her**, I took a long look at **her** face, staring into **her** eyes, I saw how **she** searched around in herself,
consulting **her** feelings and wants. After a while, **she** told me that **she** would like to kiss me. **She** said
it wasn't on gay panic level of wanting to, I could rest assured that my decision on it is truly affecting just myself,
but **she** would enjoy it. I got to ponder those thoughts for a while.

As we changed trains we went for the Restaurant to have some dinner as it was getting late. In between being approached
by board personnel and ordering food, we cuddled up, played a little bit with each other. The seats in
that cart were much better for cuddles. As I buried my head in **her** neck, to be embraced by **her** arms, a wonderful
thing happened. I am a person with a very good sense of smell, I smell the intricacies of most food dishes, I smell
everything that recently happened in a room, and most importantly.. I smell people. Every human has an individual smell
to them, every human smell is affected by what they eat, what they did that day, and what hormones dominate their
endocrine system. I was so much into boy and girl smell...<br/>
And I suddenly smelled **her**.<br/>
The day had progressed that **her** early morning shower gave way to **her** unique smell and as my head was resting on
**her** chest. I finally got to smell **her**. **Her** womanly smell was getting me drunk. I told **her** how much I
enjoyed smelling people, but especially how much I enjoyed smelling **her**. I told **her** that the person I loved has
a genetic condition, making it so their hormones are more equally balanced, giving them a unique non-binary smell I was
addicted to, but smelling **her**,,,,, oh my god. As the thoughts about the question of kissing **her** bounced around
in my head I was getting addicted to **her** smell. It was putting me over the edge.

The board personell told us we should please stop cuddling in the Restaurant. That woman was already annoying other
guests with her attitude of absolute enforcement of rules, very German I guess. Whenever that woman would look
away, we cuddled a little bit anyway. **She** played with my leg, I leaned on **her** sneakily. I loved this so
much,,,,,,

The train was getting close to my station. I would get off alone there so our goodbye was quickly approaching. My wishes
for a delay were unfulfilled, fair enough considering how I got every other of mine that weekend fulfilled to it's
fullest,,,<br />
I was asked once more...<br />
How shall we part ways today? I was nervous. Many thoughts bounced around in my head. I had only ever kissed one
person in my life. I knew I wasn't good at it. I wasn't sure if I would like. I didn't want to ruin these final
moments I shared with someone precious, like I had so so so so so many times in the past year. I was pondering.<br/>
I really wanted to want to kiss **her**... I remember how I pressed against **her**... I remembered the smell of
**her**... I really liked my time with **her**... Nobody asked my wishes and my consent like **her**...<br />
I want **her**<br/>
I want to kiss **her**<br/>
I **want** to **kiss** **her**<br/>
My heart started beating fast, I told **her**. I told **her** I wanted a parting kiss. In **her** now so familiar
and sweet and hot way **she** asked me once more to clarify.. a short sweet kiss? Or *more*? I didn't need to think for
long, but was still shy saying it... I would like a bit more than that,,,,,<br/>
The train approached the station, I grabbed my things to bring them to the door. I walked the long pathway of the train
cart, **she** was behind me following.<br/>
I arrived at the door, put down my things. I turned around, seeing **her** approach. Watching **her** come closer and
closer.<br/>
My restraints broke away, I opened my arms. I went from accepting, to welcoming, to wishing, to wanting, to needing,
in the fractions of a second it took **her** to meet me.<br/>
I had **her** in my arms, my face close to **hers**.. we got closer, and closer, and closer. My lips started to meet
**hers**. A gentle small kiss. Another one. Every little bit of doubt and restrained I had broke like a rope under
tension, a quick snap. We were making out. I felt **her** tongue in my mouth, **she** tasted so goddamn sweet, the
sweetest I ever tasted. **Her** lips on mine felt like a natural fit, like a higher entity crafted them to be fitted
together. We kissed and kissed and kissed and kissed. God make this last forever, I am **hers**, **she** consumed me,
I wanted to be consumed. The train arrived in the station, the doors were yet to open. A kiss, another. A short break,
a short little sweet kiss, like a little interlude between two major songs of a band. I raised **her** hand to my lips
and gave them a kiss. I thanked **her**. We pulled each other close again. I was once more blessed by **her** lips,
**her** tongue in my mouth, the sweet taste of **her**. Oh the taste of **her**,,,,, The doors were opening. Our lips parted.
I still tasted **her**. **she** gave me a little kiss on the forehead. We put our faces together, a sweet little
embrace. **She** kissed my nose. I had to say goodbye. A short little kiss.<br/>
I left out of the door.

<br/>

I walked home, it was dark already and very cold, but I needed that to cool down. The weather felt quite right for my
state of mind as I indulged in my memories every step. I could still taste **her** in my mouth, I cherished that
so much. I still had **her** bruises on my shoulders, I caressed them, having the pain remind me of **her**.

I hope I can see **her** again soon
