On Friday I embarked on a longer train trip to an event I get to visit every few months. The details are relatively unimportant but essentially, I was to spend the weekend at a place, visiting courses throughout the day, taking part in activities in between, and staying the night with other people, some familiar, some unknown in bigger rooms that accommodate around 15 people usually. I am always excited when I get to go there because there is quite a high ratio of nerds and queers around these events, and usually I spend every night awake till 3am playing games and talking with cool and interesting people.

As I've been to these events a couple of times now, I know quite a lot of people that go there regularly too, got some cliques I'm part of. However, many of my friends and acquaintances did not make it this weekend. Apart from one close friend and a few people I know relatively well I was missing a lot of familiar faces. When I arrived and checked who of the 500 participants this time I would know I would come up rather short. This isn't bad per se, as every time I participate I get to know a lot of new people and make new connections, but this weekend I really was not in the mood to socialize much, I wanted to hang out with friends to take a break from my very stressful everyday life I have right now. Paired with some other Issues I was experiencing (including my period that day) I was a fair amount in pain and a bit grumpy at times. At one time I sat down in the reception, where I found a familiar face and a <span style="color: orange">somewhat familiar one</span> I couldn't place initially. My acquaintance was sitting at a desk with a laptop, welcoming new arrivals and checking them in, much like two others were doing nearby. They were a little bit stressed every time a new bus rolled in, bringing about 50 to 80 arrivals. Next to them, sitting on the floor was a <span style="color: orange">girl</span> I somewhat recognized, but nothing more. I know so many people and meet so many people, especially at these events, that it's hard to retain everyone in detail, and my memory takes time sometimes. As I was a bit down and suffering from gramps I sat down next to <span style="color: orange">her</span>, so I could chat with them.

This turned into kind of a slow evening, me sitting there talking to them, a bit in pain trying to be my usual funny and charming self, somewhat failing as thinking straight was hard. I specifically remember <span style="color: orange">her</span> asking me at some point if there was something someone could do for me, and my brain noticing the opportunity for a funny flirt but running completely blank just made me stare at <span style="color: orange">her</span>  for probably a solid 10 seconds before coming with a very stupid response, followed by an apology about me not being very articulate at the time. <span style="color: orange">She</span>  was cute and at some time late I started leaning on <span style="color: orange">her</span>  a little, taking comfort in another persons touch to raise my mood and ease my discomfort. Through some contrivance I can't quite remember anymore I also got <span style="color: orange">her</span>  number. All I have right now as a memory aid is me writing "meow" so I have no fucking idea what lead to that. <br />
When it got late we left for dinner. We each had dinner at different places so we split, and afterward I would go to bed fairly early. Normally I would not take care of my sleep schedule at these events but I was not feeling well, hadn't slept much the days prior and figured that on the first night of these events nothing much happened anyway as everyone arrived and settled in their rooms. I had met my friend for a short talk and walk after dinner but then we both went to bed, determined to enjoy the next day to the fullest.

That day started fairly predictable. Breakfast and embarking to my course. It was a quiet, slow and enjoyable start but despite me having slept fairly well I was a bit tired still when lunchtime came around. After that there was an activity where people, mostly queers, got together to spend some time together, exchange some nail polish and paint nails together. I got to see <span style="color: orange">her</span> again there, got to chat a bit more, and got some.. vibes. After the 2h midday break everyone gone back to their courses, where I proceeded to almost fall asleep... So afterward's, as I was sitting in the dinning room having my meal, I had an idea of laying down a bit afterward since I didn't see any interesting activity advertised for after dinner until much later. I had a fairly smart idea as it were to later turn out, as I had <span style="color: orange">her</span> number in my phone I decided on a whim to just ask if <span style="color: orange">she</span> wanted to join me, laying down and maybe taking a nap together. In the past I would have been too shy or insecure to just casually ask someone that, but as I was vibing fairly well with <span style="color: orange">her</span> the day prior and this year overall made me more confident, I just asked away. <span style="color: orange">Her</span>  reply did not take too long, <span style="color: orange">she</span>  was up for it. Gave me something nice to look forward to while finishing my food.

I returned to my room after dinner, changed into some more comfortable clothes, and lied down at my little bed. It would be a bit hard and convoluted to describe how the... sleeping situation at these places was, but basically these rooms would often be used for like summer camps for teenagers and the likes, and our event used it as a cheap place for people to just have their 3h of sleep in between courses, activities and hanging out with people. My "bed" was basically a narrow matt, next to two others "beds", with a basic pillow and bedsheet and a bigger plush of mine I use as a sort of side pillow when sleeping. I liked being at the end of that group of mattes, basically laying in the corner of the room, it's cozy in a.. cat-brained way. <br/>
Shortly after I was ready <span style="color: orange">she</span> showed up, having brought a little plush of <span style="color: orange">her</span>  own which was really cute. To paint you a picture, <span style="color: orange">she</span>  is a relatively thin cute girl, about my height (so around 1.70m). <span style="color: orange">She</span>  had a soft demeanor and a really cute face, a petite chest and a cute, comfy, practical outfit consisting of a relatively plain shirt and a cute set of shorts later to be revealed to me to be actually a piece of swimwear <span style="color: orange">she</span>  finds comfortable for sleeping. <span style="color: orange">She</span>  had this little blue shark plushy with <span style="color: orange">her</span>  that I thought was cute. I later found out a bit about her, that <span style="color: orange">she</span>  had taken notice at past events of me and a very close friend of mine. <span style="color: orange">She</span>  was a relatively young trans girl that had only in recent months embraced <span style="color: orange">her</span>  transition, which explained some of <span style="color: orange">her</span>  personality traits to me.
 <span style="color: orange">She</span>  joined me, laid down next to me in my little bed. We two barely fit on the matt, but as <span style="color: orange">she</span>  leaned onto me that was more of a feature than an obstacle. I embraced her, took <span style="color: orange">her</span>  into my arms. <span style="color: orange">Her</span>  shy and reserved demeanor encouraged me to take <span style="color: orange">her</span>  in caringly, embrace <span style="color: orange">her</span>  closely. As we both settled in I caressed <span style="color: orange">her</span>  a little. Running my hands and nails over <span style="color: orange">her</span>  arm. I quickly noticed that we were quite similar, <span style="color: orange">she</span>  was very sensitive, <span style="color: orange">her</span>  skin was sensitive, and <span style="color: orange">she</span>  quite enjoyed what I did. I was a little reminded of me spending my first night in that hotel room with **her**, but roles reversed this time. I had <span style="color: orange">her</span>  in my arms and started spoiling her, running my hand now not only on <span style="color: orange">her</span>  arm, but also the side of <span style="color: orange">her</span>  chest, more and more down to <span style="color: orange">her</span>  hips. I played around a bit with the pressure of my fingers and my hand overall. Learning massaging recently taught me not only the different ways I can differ amounts of pressure on a variety of areas on someone's body, but overall learned were bones and muscles were, and how to use my hand effectively to navigate and stimulate them. I quickly got to enjoy the little noises <span style="color: orange">she</span>  made, it was easy to see what <span style="color: orange">she</span>  enjoyed most. The more I played around, explored, the more I noticed how <span style="color: orange">her</span>  body worked very similar to mine, what <span style="color: orange">she</span>  enjoyed I usually enjoyed too. As you can already guess, we did not nap. The hours went by fast, and consisted of me holding her, exploring <span style="color: orange">her</span>  upper body and making <span style="color: orange">her</span>  make all sorts of cute noises. My room was very deserted luckily, as <span style="color: orange">she</span>  was very shy and would not like anyone hearing or seeing <span style="color: orange">her</span>  like that. But <span style="color: orange">she</span> did enjoy what I did, and we cuddled closer and closer, and I got to touch more and more of her. I managed to take care of <span style="color: orange">her</span> neck and <span style="color: orange">her</span> hips when our time came to an end and we left for an activity we wanted to attend (A whiskey tasting with some cool people.. afterwards we both went to bed for good reason).

When we parted ways there was an understanding between us that there was more to this, more that could happen. This whole event only spanned from friday to monday, with courses only really happening on saturday and sunday as on the other days people arrived or left, and there was a vibe that we would spend the last night together.

The next day, Sunday, a slow and normal start. Lunch approached and there was an activity afterward that I wanted to join, and that I was sure <span style="color: orange">she</span> would join as well. It is pretty much tradition at this point that we would do a little (or not that little) queer meetup, sometimes just to hang out with other queer people, sometimes to discuss topics and give each other tips on dealing with things like school, university, parents and general queer experiences. As our group found together in one of the dinning rooms we had done a bigger circle of chairs, we started discussing some potential topics to talk about as more and more people joined. Because we were around 30 or so people we decided to split up into smaller groups, each grabbing one or two topics to talk about so people could come together based on discussing those, elder queers often sharing their experiences and younger ones listening. The group I ended up joining, because I had some stories to share, was also shared by her, and some other people familiar to me. We moved over to the little hang out space of someone's room and talked. <span style="color: orange">She</span>  sat next to me and I got to cuddle <span style="color: orange">her</span>  a bit. Some other people also cuddled up onto each other and we discussed the before agreed topics at first, but quickly devolved into just hanging out. I got to lean onto <span style="color: orange">her</span>  shoulder, this time being a little bit taken care of by <span style="color: orange">her</span>. In the presence of the others we were very timid of course, but never really distanced from the other, rather getting closer as time gone by. At some point I quietly proposed something to her. As this was the last day of courses, the afternoon would be spend with each course presenting to others what they had done and learned, usually people would divide that time up into different shifts as that whole thing spanned around four hours. So I figured... If I were to pick the last of those shifts, and <span style="color: orange">she</span>  would too, and everyone being at that central gathering places strolling around, listening to other people presenting their courses, the rooms we stayed in would be fairly.. quiet. I proposed the idea to <span style="color: orange">her</span> of us meeting up for the time until then.. <span style="color: orange">she</span> was a bit dense at first not understanding what I was aluding to, telling <span style="color: orange">her</span>  I would bring <span style="color: orange">her</span> the plush <span style="color: orange">she</span> forgot in my room yesterday only as to not alert others in the room to my ulterior motives. <span style="color: orange">She</span>  did catch on eventually and agreed. As the course time approached our group dissolved, meeting up at our course rooms to divide the shifts, me volunteering for the last one. <span style="color: orange">She</span>  had written me <span style="color: orange">she</span> also got the last shift, so once everything was decided I had gone to my room, to change my outfit a little and grab <span style="color: orange">her</span>  little shark.

It took a bit of back and forth, but I ended up in <span style="color: orange">her</span>  room. <span style="color: orange">Her</span>  bed was a bit more central, at the end of another three-matt arrangement but more in the middle of the room. Again, discussing layout would be difficult but <span style="color: orange">her</span>  bed was a bit hidden from the entrance, you would not see it when entering the room but would if you were to go to the bathroom or to some of the other beds, as you were walking around a little half wall that obfuscated the view to it. We laid down and started cuddling. I picked back up where I had left previously. It was a bit more busy around than anticipated, every now and then people entered the room to get something, so sometimes we heard the door open and would quiet down, just embracing each other like in a platonic cuddle, of which there was plenty at those events, there were many queers after all. As soon as someone left my hand would be once more down at <span style="color: orange">her</span>  hips, later <span style="color: orange">her</span>  tummy. Every now and then I asked where I could touch her, at some point I asked <span style="color: orange">her</span>  if <span style="color: orange">she</span>  would like me to kiss <span style="color: orange">her</span>  forehead, which <span style="color: orange">she</span>  enthusiastically agreed to. I would hold <span style="color: orange">her</span>  close, caress <span style="color: orange">her</span>  caringly, give <span style="color: orange">her</span>  little kisses on <span style="color: orange">her</span>  forehead, <span style="color: orange">her</span>  cheek, <span style="color: orange">her</span> neck. <span style="color: orange">Her</span>  making all kinds of cute little noises in the process, I could easily see how much <span style="color: orange">she</span>  enjoyed what I did, how much it gave <span style="color: orange">her</span>. It made me happy and drove me to move further and further. I kissed the farther part of <span style="color: orange">her</span>  cheek, I kissed a bit closer to the center, I kissed the center of <span style="color: orange">her</span>  cheek, the next one closer to <span style="color: orange">her</span>  lips, closer, closer, a kiss just at the edge of <span style="color: orange">her</span>  mouth. I moved on top of <span style="color: orange">her</span>, my face closer to <span style="color: orange">hers</span>, I asked if <span style="color: orange">she</span> wanted me to kiss <span style="color: orange">her</span>. Getting <span style="color: orange">her</span>  shy but determined consent I moved closer, me on top of <span style="color: orange">her</span>, my hands on <span style="color: orange">her</span>  body, my lips approaching hers. A little caring kiss, our lips touching, my hands grasping more firm, another kiss, another, another, another. Little gentle kisses turned into more and more firmer meetings, turned intenser, turned into a light make out, soon our lips joined by our tongues. <span style="color: orange">She</span>  tasted so good, I could not contain myself. I grasped <span style="color: orange">her</span>  firmly, I explored the various regions of <span style="color: orange">her</span>  lips, <span style="color: orange">her</span>  mouth, hearing <span style="color: orange">her</span>  making little noises barely audible as our lips constantly met. Remembering what I enjoyed most, and how similar <span style="color: orange">she</span>  was to me, every now and then I hesitated a short moment just to gently lick <span style="color: orange">her</span>  lips, <span style="color: orange">her</span>  moaning in absolute bliss before I once more started to consume her. My hands became more daring, moving under <span style="color: orange">her</span>  shirt, firmly gripping <span style="color: orange">her</span>  hips just the way I enjoyed myself too, approaching <span style="color: orange">her</span>  chest but not yet embracing it, in a little game of teasing as I kissed <span style="color: orange">her</span>, kissed <span style="color: orange">her</span>  cheek, kissed <span style="color: orange">her</span>  neck. It all joined by the symphony of <span style="color: orange">her</span>  noises. Sometimes we heard the door, quiet down for a moment until the person left again. In between lustfully making out we had little laughs, as <span style="color: orange">her</span>  neck was very sensitive and it was a gamble if a kiss would excite <span style="color: orange">her</span>  or tingle <span style="color: orange">her</span>. As we quieted down every now and then when someone entered the room we smiled to each other, feeling like teenagers hiding from one of our parents potentially walking in on us, it was so playful and enjoyable. At some point our time was running short, so once we got to let go of one another we got up, got ready to leave. As we were about to leave the room, I figured I'd do something I always wanted to do, and wanted to be done to me. I grabbed <span style="color: orange">her</span>  arm, <span style="color: orange">her</span>  hips, and pressed <span style="color: orange">her</span>  against the wall and started making out with her, then kissing <span style="color: orange">her</span>  neck. <span style="color: orange">She</span>  loved that, and so did I. Later on <span style="color: orange">she</span>  would specifically tell me how much <span style="color: orange">she</span>  enjoyed that I spontaneously pressed <span style="color: orange">her</span>  against the wall.

I joined someone else from my course to spend the next hour explaining things to people (well, he did, I just stood there as I did not understand much from it anyway and even had fallen asleep at the course sometimes). At some point I had a little chat with one of the queers from earlier, which caught on that I had quite a... cuddly break in between the queer group meeting and now. She kind of figured that the person I was with there and was relatively cuddly with was potentially the one I had spend that time with, so I had to gaslight her a little bit, girlboss as I am, as to not blow our secret that instantly. Afterwards it was once more time for dinner. And after that would be a bit of a break for which <span style="color: orange">she</span>  would join me at my room again for cuddles. A bit later that evening there would be an event where everyone gathered and spend the evening together for a bit of a presentation and celebration until late in the night usually, followed by dancing and the likes. As it was viewed by many as the central, last activity on that weekend it was very very unlikely for people to not attend. So... we figured... if we left early, we would be very alone for quite a while. So that was quickly decided to be our evening plans. We left for that after a round of close but timid cuddles.

As the event ramped up, we left even earlier than originally planned, due to some circumstance. We ended up at my room once more, and after a bit of a break due to aforementioned circumstances, we ended up at my bed once more. This time, as a bit of a payback tho, <span style="color: orange">she</span>  pressed *me* against the wall before we would lay down. I really loved that. As we lied there, there were no restraints this time, we knew for the next few hours we would be completely alone, no distraction, just each other.

I did not hold back anymore, I started graping <span style="color: orange">her</span>  in all the places I knew <span style="color: orange">she</span>  would like. I grasped <span style="color: orange">her</span>  breasts as I made out with her, as I kissed <span style="color: orange">her</span>  neck, as I bite <span style="color: orange">her</span>  neck. <span style="color: orange">Her</span>  not holding back <span style="color: orange">her</span>  noises, partly because we were this alone, partly because <span style="color: orange">she</span>  just couldn't. My hand would run down <span style="color: orange">her</span>  side, pressing gently against her, approaching <span style="color: orange">her</span>  hips, and pressing into them, firmly grasping around her. I enjoyed the noises <span style="color: orange">she</span>  made from this, I loved this myself, the firm grasp kind of stimulating all the nervs of the lower body, including the very sensitive ones on the belly, the lower back and... what was below that. I kissed <span style="color: orange">her</span>  neck, I kissed <span style="color: orange">her</span>  arms, I kissed <span style="color: orange">her</span>  upper chest, I kissed <span style="color: orange">her</span>  tummy. I more and more lifted <span style="color: orange">her</span>  shirt, until I reached <span style="color: orange">her</span>  timid breasts. Even tho <span style="color: orange">she</span>  was not on estrogen for that long <span style="color: orange">she</span>  was already lucky enough to have a bit larger chest than I had, be it in a much earlier stage of development. I ran my hand around <span style="color: orange">her</span>  breasts, my fingers around <span style="color: orange">her</span>  nipples, watching <span style="color: orange">her</span>  move and moan in bliss, when I engaged one of my favorite intimate techniques. I moved my lips towards <span style="color: orange">her</span>  chest, I started licking the side of them, moved my tongue around <span style="color: orange">her</span>  nipples, <span style="color: orange">her</span>  being now unable to control <span style="color: orange">her</span>  body, moving uncontrollably to the tune of my body and my lips. I pressed myself against her, matching <span style="color: orange">her</span>  rhythm, and started sucking on <span style="color: orange">her</span>  breast. <span style="color: orange">She</span>  was in pure bliss, I thrust myself against her, my lips on <span style="color: orange">her</span>  chest, my tongue playing with <span style="color: orange">her</span>  petite breasts. <span style="color: orange">She</span>  was completely taken over, I was completely engaged in <span style="color: orange">her</span>  every move, <span style="color: orange">her</span>  every noise, hungering more and more for <span style="color: orange">her</span>. My chest pressed closely against <span style="color: orange">her</span>  tummy, my hips moved in rhythm with <span style="color: orange">hers</span>. It was almost sexual in the lesbian kind of way. After a while <span style="color: orange">she</span> pushed me away a bit and told me <span style="color: orange">she</span>  was starting to be completely overwhelmed. I moved on to more gentle techniques, little kisses around <span style="color: orange">her</span>  neck, on <span style="color: orange">her</span>  chest, gentle kisses on <span style="color: orange">her</span>  lips, my hand around <span style="color: orange">her</span>  hips, <span style="color: orange">her</span>  tummy, running over <span style="color: orange">her</span>  arms, around <span style="color: orange">her</span>  neck, grasping <span style="color: orange">her</span>  cheeks, my fingers every now and then playing around <span style="color: orange">her</span>  and with <span style="color: orange">her</span>  lips, soon to be joined by my tongue and my lips. I played around all the areas of <span style="color: orange">her</span>  bodies I was allowed to explore previously, I grasped <span style="color: orange">her</span>  hips, the tights, I pressed my thumb against <span style="color: orange">her</span>  lower lips, we made out, hours seemingly passed in minutes. <br/>
At some point I truly had extracted all the serotonins <span style="color: orange">her</span>  body would give, I switched to aftercare. I embraced <span style="color: orange">her</span>  closely, wrapping my arms around <span style="color: orange">her</span>  neck, protecting <span style="color: orange">her</span>  head. I gently kissed <span style="color: orange">her</span>  forehead, told <span style="color: orange">her</span>  she was a good girl and moved my hands over <span style="color: orange">her</span>  hair. The event seemingly was wrapping up and people were starting to come to our room. <span style="color: orange">She</span>  was laying in my arms, closely embraced, as people came in and out of the room. From the outside we looked relatively innocent, two queer woman closely cuddling as you would see not too uncommonly there, lacking the context of the previous hours. I had <span style="color: orange">her</span>  stay that night, us sharing this very small bed was a bit crammed, but this wasn't about the most resting sleep, this was about me having <span style="color: orange">her</span> in my arms for a few hours more. <br/>
A bit early in the morning, before everyone else was awake, <span style="color: orange">she</span>  woke up and left for <span style="color: orange">her</span>  room, as this was the departure day <span style="color: orange">she</span> wanted to go back to pack <span style="color: orange">her</span>  things to be prepared for later. I gave <span style="color: orange">her</span>  a little kiss before <span style="color: orange">she</span>  left, as everyone around us was asleep.

The morning started very trivially, breakfast, then everyone getting their luggage ready and cleaning out our rooms. Afterwards we all gathered in the big meeting area for a last goodbye from the people that organised this all and for some announcements. As different people took different trains at different times, a bus schedule divided us all into different groups, some leaving immediately, some much later. <span style="color: orange">She</span> was scheduled to leave one bus before me, but we had a bit of time before that. I also found my friend, but as she left even earlier I only had a quick chat and goodbye with her, didn't even have time to girl talk with her (aka, tell her about my weekend). Thinking about it I didn't even had time to tell her about **her**, as we had only seen each other the christ
mas before, two months before that infamous weekend and the night in that hotel room.

As the first people had left and we said goodbye, and my friend left, me and <span style="color: orange">her</span> stole us away to a bit of an remote area. It was a little playground in view of the larger group, but far enough away that I could give <span style="color: orange">her</span>  little kisses without anyone seeing what we were up to. We talked a bit about the time we spend together, I kissed <span style="color: orange">her</span>  a couple more times. <span style="color: orange">She</span>  asked me how I had so much stamina, that I still had the energy to thirst after <span style="color: orange">her</span>  like that, I didn't really have an answer... <span style="color: orange">she</span>  is just so hot I can't keep my hands or my lips off of <span style="color: orange">her</span>. We also had a very nice talk about we both can't understand how people can be monogamous.. there are just so many cool people out there, how could you ever choose just one of them?? Anyway, <span style="color: orange">her</span>  departure time drew close, so we re-joined the group, grabbed <span style="color: orange">her</span>  luggage and gathered at the departure point for the bus. <span style="color: orange">Her</span>  things got loaded, and we shared a close hug in front of the bus, in the view of quite a lot of other people, some bound to leave as well and others saying goodbye. As our arms parted a bit I saw <span style="color: orange">her</span>  gathering some resolve to overcome <span style="color: orange">her</span>  shyness, <span style="color: orange">her</span>  scaredness of what other people would think of <span style="color: orange">her</span>  and us that motivated <span style="color: orange">her</span>  hiding the things we did that weekend. <span style="color: orange">She</span>  asked me... would I like a goodbye kiss? I, of course, could not ever deny that, I wanted <span style="color: orange">her</span>, this was potentially the last time we would see each other for months, as we decided these events are the only time we would be together like that. So we kissed, a bit away but totally in view of a lot of other people. We parted and <span style="color: orange">she</span>  boarded the bus. I joined back with the main group, spend some time near my familiar queers but a bit.. positively melancholic, keeping to myself and playing a bit with my guitar, quietly reflecting and just turning my mood into some gentle tunes.

As my bus was the one just after hers, my time to board quickly approached. I said goodbye to some of the people in passing as not many of my friends remain, mostly just acquaintances, and I boarded my bus. After a little lengthy ride we arrived at the train station. As it turns out, and as was often the case, the train schedule and actual arrival time of some of them meant that some of the people that left earlier did not depart with a train just yet... among them, <span style="color: orange">her</span>. It felt a bit like fate. So I got a bit of extra time with <span style="color: orange">her</span>, a few more minutes. We and a few others left for the platform <span style="color: orange">her</span>  train would arrive on, me close to her, around <span style="color: orange">her</span>  arm, hugging <span style="color: orange">her</span>  and embracing her. Some others were around us but we were busy with each other a lot of the time anyway. <br/>
As the train arrived, after a bit of scheduling chaos due to one train many originally wanted to board just.. missing our train station (according to some train nerds, that's not too uncommon on more remote stations) <span style="color: orange">her</span>  train was rolling in. <span style="color: orange">She</span>  gave me a little kiss and wanted to join the others close to the train door, but as the train was just rolling in <span style="color: orange">she</span>  was a bit undecided, walking back and forth a little between the others and me, cute and shy as <span style="color: orange">she</span>  is. After enjoying that view for a bit I took a step towards her, gestured to <span style="color: orange">her</span>  to come over to me, a bit demanding like the gentle top I had been that weekend. As <span style="color: orange">she</span>  came closer, I grabbed <span style="color: orange">her</span> close, kissed <span style="color: orange">her</span>, made out with <span style="color: orange">her</span>  a little bit, the others in view be dammed. I got this second last moment and I made most of it, taste <span style="color: orange">her</span>  one more time. After that I let go of her, <span style="color: orange">she</span>  really enjoyed that, but then really had to leave and board the train, so a final final goodbye this time. <span style="color: orange">She</span> got on that train and that was the last time I would see <span style="color: orange">her</span>  for probably quite a while. I much later that day did get some messages from <span style="color: orange">her</span>  tho, telling me <span style="color: orange">she</span>  safely arrived at home, so I got to give <span style="color: orange">her</span>  some virtual kisses and tell <span style="color: orange">her</span>  I did so as well.

I will probably not hear from <span style="color: orange">her</span>  until I see <span style="color: orange">her</span>  next time, which might be this summer, around August, if I manage to gather the time and funds to visit the next event were <span style="color: orange">she</span>  would be too potentially, or otherwise will have to wait until the event in winter around new years. That is of course only if we don't decide to see each other outside of those events, but I leave that up to <span style="color: orange">her</span>. I felt like a silly teenager that weekend having a platonic summer romance, and I enjoyed every bit of it. That however, will not be the only thing that would happen that week that just started that day...
