A little note I want to add here about the purpose of this blog, as it had come up twice now and might here again.
No events described here are fictional, all is truthful. My style of writing is not the classic school taught way to
do it, it intends to convey **emotions**. I am an extremely emotional person and I view writing as art, those
lines are the canvas through which I paint what I experienced in a way to makes the reader hopefully beginn to feel and
understand how I felt and feel. That being said, for the sake of brevity, focus and anonymity, I will always highlight
certain aspects relevant to my focus, the intimate or kinky times I spend with people, mentioning other events only as
far as it involved my emotions related to that. A dinner I describe flirting with someone only to be "turned down" does
not say anything about them or how I read them, or even if I read them as rejecting me, it only informs my feeling of
touch-starvedness enforced, completely subjectively and impulsively, as I am.  
I felt like highlighting this because my last story contained a lot of people, some of which might and have recognized
themselves in it. This story only contains me and **her**, but it will still leave out a lot in order to focus on the
intimate parts of it, because those are what I want to share, what I want to share with **her**.

Hello darlings~~

Friday was Valentine's Day and while I originally thought it would be a quiet day for myself, as my few arrangements
with people were originally for Sunday (including a coffee date that fell through) it took a sudden twist for the...
intimate.

The day was nice and slow, I took a long and hot shower while listening loudly to Bring me the Horizons' album
"POST HUMAN: NeX GEn". When evening was drawing near my girlfriends sister came over for dinner, we were ordering
food from our favorite taiwanese place before the two of them would go to her place to spend time together and
attend some events tomorrow. As I was contemplating what to do on my own later that night, since it's rare for me
to have my introvert gf out of the house, I usually spend such an evening eating food she doesn't like or loudly 
listening to music while doing one of my more abstruse hobbies.

My plans had been quickly overturned as the sudden vibration of my phone displayed a message from... **her**. We were
already thinking about hanging out together on Sunday spontaneously if our schedules aligned, but plans had changed.  
**She** asked me if I would like **her** to come over.
As I would have the place to myself with my gf staying at her sister's place, and **her** needing some time to get here
so I'd have some moments to prepare, I told **her** I would love for us to spend time together.
This evening was not intended to be something like when last time I met **her**. I was not mentally prepared to spend my
evening like that again, and I also read between the lines what **she** needed was companionship and someone to take her
mind off of things (an assumption that proofed correct). But this will be the last time I mention this here.

As my girlfriend and her sister left, I had some time to myself. Over the last two weeks I had a lot of time
to reflect on everything, I mean I created a whole blog about it. These events have showing and proven a lot of
things to me. I had been a touch starved, unliked mess all my life, only having gained friends in the last five years of
my life, but never having had something as intimate as that Sunday night. Many disappointments, romantically and just
intimately littered my past. But that night, a night which fulfilled all my bodily urges, my souls craving for 
connection fot intimacy, really was something I had craved for long. Not because of romanticism or anything, although 
I'm a very hopeless romantic. Because of the pure, raw need for touch and intimacy. Having gained a friend that would 
cuddle me for hours, who would bite me if I'd ask, who would give me hickeys and bruises, who in the end I can even make 
out with, was amazing. I felt amazing these last two weeks. My life was as happy as it always had been, but I was relaxed 
like never before, and the bad days felt so much less bad than they had previously - nights did not feel lonely anymore. 
Writing **her** made me feel appreciated in a certain way I had lacked so far. Not being touch-starved as a base state 
of being had removed all discomfort I could have felt late at night or in an uncomfortable social situation. Starvation 
has been replaced with a healthy appetite. I felt more healthy overall, on a mental level. (it also helped with my 
tensed up shoulders,,).

These two weeks also put something else on me.. anticipation. I am always scared of that, I hate getting
my hopes up or to expect certain things. I fear having unrealistic expectations, I dread it. I live taking life as it 
hits me, having a general plan but adapting to what I am given. I hate being disappointing and being disappointed through 
unrealistic expectations. So now, as **she** was  going to be with me once more I felt an anxiety in me building. I did 
not want to expect, I did not want to overthink, I wanted to just be.. with *her*. I wrote **her** something that 
probably only made this much sense to me, but  
"I don't want **her**, I want *you*"  
I wanted to get to know *her* more, I wanted to spend time with *her*, connect with *her*.

I put on some nice clothes, nothing special. A bra I wasn't wearing often, without pads that just
supported my petite chest - my breasts aren't very big, but today I felt confident just showing off their natural,
beautiful shape. Accentuating my curves I put on one of my slim fit shirts from anna field with a deep cut that I love
so much. I added a pair of comfi pants to it, the ones you can comfortably sleep in but also take to the grocery store, 
if it's not too high class. It all came together as a subtle homey look, something that looks low effort in a good
way. There is all sorts of hot outfits and lingerie I could have put on or put on underneath, but this is not what I
wanted to project onto this evening, I just wanted to lay in *her* arms and talk to her for hours... and a kiss or ten.

As I had seen her train arriving in the station (according to the train web page anyway), my anxiety was growing by
the minute. Would I be able to give *her* what she needs? Would I be able to not disappoint myself?  
I did not have too much time to ponder this thankfully, as *she* wrote me of her arrival.  
I got downstairs to meet *her* and help navigate the maze that is our apartment complex. A hug. We boarded the elevator.
I did not know if a kiss had been appropriate, so I had hold off on that. I lead *her* too my apartment, had
*her* arrive first. *She* put her stuff down in the little entrance area of our small apartment, washed *her* hands.
I got to give her a little tour, this was the bedroom, this the everything-else-room with a little living room area
and a dinning area, separated by our desks, around the corner the entrance to our tiny kitchen that was a mess right
now.  
We sat down on the couch, got to talk. I learned what made *her* come here today spontaneously, I got to know *her*. I
asked about *her* interests, the series *she* watched, the games *she* played. Me leaning on *her* turned into me laying
down on *her* lap on *her* request, *she* gave me little scratches while we talked. The hours passed.  
I got to learn so much about *her*, it felt intimate not because of the touch of our skin but of our hearts. Emotional
closeness was mirrored by the physical. *She* took of my shirt, I leaned on *her*, between *her* legs, like that night.
I showed off my cute bra, a plain white one with a strong band underneath to highlight what's there, but barely anything
else. Thin enough to not even hide visually what it contained, let alone the shape and detail of it, a little bow in
the middle I loved. *Her* hands running over my skin was a nice sensation again. This time *her* nails had a new shape,
making them still pointy but less sharp, changing the sensation on my skin from a scratching to a more massaging one.  
We looked at the time, four hours had already passed. We both couldn't believe it was almost midnight.

We both were getting sleepy so we relocated to the bedroom. The big queen-sized bed I bought years ago was rarely
actually used for cuddles - actually only with that one person I was in love with on like two occasions - , even tho 
it's size, decor and plushies were inviting. I laid down invitingly in the middle,
*she* undressed and come in to my right. *She* took off my bra and I laid down in *her* arms. We talked some more. I felt
*her* and myself get sleepy, but a desire had build in me. I did not kiss *her* so far this evening, but I felt it was
something I wanted the more we talked. As I connected more and more to *her*, I did not want to end the day without a
kiss. I was feeling a bit guilty as *she* was getting sleep ready. At some point I finally collected my resolve. I
raised up a little, slightly leaning over *her*. I said "I really don't want to keep you from sleeping, but,,,," and
came closer. I was met with an inviting atmosphere, *her* lips meeting mine. A simple kiss quickly tuned into a deep
embrace, making out. I felt wanting *her* more and more and more and more. I was such a greedy bitch, but *she* also
leaned into it. It got messy, I wasn't holding back anymore and neither was *she*. We embraced each other and made out
like it was the last time we would ever see each other. *She* flipped us around, I was at the bottom now, where I
belonged. *She* sat on top of me, *her* hands on my chest, *her* lips on mine. *She* raised herself up, sitting on me.
I had to catch my breath, tried to say something unsuccessfully. *She* waited for me until I could finally speak again.
".. as I said, I didn't want to keep you from sleeping,,," &ndash; "oh don't worry, I'm **awake** now,,,".  
**Her** hands ran over my chest, grabbed my breast, massaged them. My body bend, my breath sharpened, it asked for
more. **She** leaned in to kiss me more, to make out more,,, god this was so much fun,,,  
**She** sat on top of me once more, asked if it would be
okay for her to give me hickeys. I told **her** I **want** them. **She** leaned in once more, kissing my neck, sucking
it, mildly biting it. It felt so good. **She** moved down to my chest, kissed my breasts just above the nipples, oh my
god,,,, the other side too,,,,, **she** moved up to my neck again,,, yessss,,,, more nibbles and bites oh god yes. I
got lightheaded. My arms wrapped around **her**, closer and closer, my fingers tried to grip **her** strong back. We
made out and I grasped for something on **her** to hold on. I grabbed **her** leg, grabbed on to **her** butt, wrapped
around **her** back. This was different from last time, it was not as mind-numbing intense as subspace, as euphoric as
the strong bite on my shoulders. This was an embrace of pure bliss of a person I connected with, someone I knew and
wanted not just on me, with me, *inside* of me (metaphorically) ((well, considering her tongue, literally)). **Her**
touch made me go crazy, I made out with **her** like I wanted to consume **her**, **her** kissing my neck literally
made my hands go numb from excitement. I told **her** how I am loosing feeling in my fingers. I pulled **her** in.
More,,,, more please,,,, more,,,,  
I got more, more and more and more. Kisses, nibbles, hickeys, **her** hands grabbing my breasts, massaging them, **her**
grip on them becoming stronger and stronger, my body bend, it invited more. My back raised from the bed, my head
burying into the pillow, my breath sharp, then still, **she** grabbed onto them more and I wanted more. I had to
remember to breath. **She** led go and kissed me again, I once more had to balance **her** inside of me with catching
enough air to not pass out. I put **her** hand on my throat, it's something I enjoyed with my girlfriend in the past
but wasn't getting these days. **She** held me firmly, it felt so good. I did not seek for **her** to restrict my breathing, 
I just wanted to feel in **her** control, in **her** power. **She** gave me that, holding me by the throat with a gentle 
but firm grip as **she** was doing things to me.  
**She** inspected me. Told me I bruise beautifully. I must admit, I lost a bit of my grip on my memory, almost passing 
out some times seem to have messed with it,,,,, blurring some of it past this point into an ecstatic blurry image of 
kisses, grabbing onto **her**, **her** grabbing into me, **her** tongue in my mouth and mine in hers, them sometimes 
meeting briefly for a heavenly embrace that made me dizzy.  
At some point we winded down, partly because I was sure I would pass out if we'd
continue, partly because I felt satisfied once more. As **she** lied down next to me, I embraced **her**
closely, I grabbed onto **her**, **she** grabbed onto me,  
I sank into **her**  
My chest pressed up against **hers**  
My head buried into **her** neck  
Our legs intertwined, mine gripped around **her** left one, **her** right one wrapped around my back and my butt  
I pulled closer, **she** pulled closer  
I pulled close, *she* pulled close  
My legs locked around *hers*, *hers* locked around me  
My head dug into *her* chest  
My breasts fitted into *her* chest  
We became one, our bodies fitted perfectly together, like made to be this way.  
I can't tell how long we laid there this way.
We exchanged some more thoughts, I told *her* how I felt. As we were both exhausted, deeply connected but sleepy, we
readied for bed. This time I stayed topless like I had been, pressed against *her*, spooned, *her* grabbing onto my
chest was comforting. I got a good night kiss. Falling asleep like this was awesome.

I slept nicely, calmly. I don't even remember waking up at night even once, which is incredibly rare for me with my
sleep problems. As I was waking up, I cuddled up to *her*. *Her* warm embrace made for a relaxing morning. I cuddled up,
our combined heat being incredibly comfi to me. We cuddled for probably an hour, I alluded at some point that we could
have breakfast, but we didn't follow up on that. As we were both awake I kissed *her*... which quickly escalated to
making out again,,,, what a way to start a day,,,,  
More cuddles followed, I opened the window and just leaned on *her*. Without the blanket, I felt the cold
Februar air is what I needed to cool down, or my blood would boil too hot. Just laying there, talking to *her*, was
awesome. As we got up I finally got to see myself in the mirror. *She* did not undersell, I bruise beautifully. Apart
from two small bruises on my breasts I had two really beautiful hickeys on my neck, big and brightly purple. Last post
I already described **her** painting on my shoulders with the brush of **her** teeth, but this time I can really call
it fine art what *her* lips have brought to this canvas. We spend some time in the everything room, sat down at the
dinning table to talk and have some snacks. I made some bread with the chocolate cream I bought in Belgium previously
and watched *her* enjoy observing the outside like a cat on a windowsill. It was peaceful just sitting there, enjoying
the calm saturday ambiance and watching *her*. *She* got her laptop to do some email stuff and offered we cuddle up
on the couch while *she* works, but I just liked sitting like this with *her* and enjoying *her* company.

Later we grabbed Lunch, had a little walk to a nearby food place. I got to hold *her* hand which I always enjoy (It was 
also helpful because I forgot my gloves..). A quick stop to take up take out, and we were on our way back enjoying the 
treasures of our adventure. Back at my apartment we did pick up a cozy spot on the couch again. Our cuddles there did not last long
before we relocated to the bed again. The topic of *her* departure came up, *she* would take a late train so we had 
some more time to cuddle and I could show *her* some of my interests. Cuddles and showing *her* a video essay of my 
favorite archeologist youtuber dunking on conspiracy theories was more fun that I would like to admit. I wanted to 
share a bit more about myself, since I received so much from *her* the day before. A lazy afternoon was blending into 
an early evening. At some point we just cuddled, almost napped.  
Evening approached, and so did *her* departure.  
It seemed as *she* wanted to have talked about it before leaving, and as our conversation topic also could lead into 
it, *she* wanted to talk to me about expectations. I was a bit confused about it, and I explained this to *her*. 
"You have been so communicative with everything else so far, I just assumed if anything would come up you'd just tell
me about it". I mean, in a way *she* just did, as *she* pointed out. *She* said *she* wanted to clarify explicitly, 
as those little gestures *she* does, kisses, hand holding, cuddles, are by traditional society considered to be 
romantic gestures, but to *her* that is not automatically assumed. As *her* feeling already told *her* probably, I just 
pointed to the hickey on my neck and "as I said previously, those are platonic bite marks :3". I am all in favor for 
affection for companionship's sake, none of these actions carry the social norms of romantic tensions 
with it for me, and I fully trust her to state so if otherwise intended. *She* reassured me *she* would tell me if that
were to ever come up. Assured in having clearly communicated intentions, *she* got up and got dressed. I got up as well
to accompany her to the front door. As *she* had collected all *her* things, we left out of my apartment, navigating 
the maze of the complex. Arriving at the front door, we shared a last kiss and parted, *she* on *her* way to the train
station, me back into the warm apartment. 

Not much later my girlfriend came home, complimenting the marks on my neck. True art really can be appreciated by any. 
From then my evening progressed as usual, so did my Sunday on which I also had my Valentine's dinner with her. I guess
to many it would be a strange contrast, the hot nights I shared with a friend to the collected mundane evening I spend
with a partner. To me, this is the life I wanted to life for a long time, and I finally have it. 

Well, one can of course always have seconds,,,

(thirds?)
